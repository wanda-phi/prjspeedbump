# FT8U232A and FT8U245A

The first generation of fixed-function D2xx devices.  The devices are:

- FT8U232AM: UART mode, 32-pin MQFP
- FT8U245AM: FIFO mode, 32-pin MQFP

Both devices look exactly the same from the software perspective, and in fact may or may not be the same silicon.

Features:

- is a full-speed USB 1.1 peripherial
- single channel D2xx device, hardwired to either UART or FIFO mode
  - no alternate bit modes
- 384-byte IN FIFO, 128-byte OUT FIFO
- 48MHz internal base clock, generated from 6MHz crystal
- 5V VCC supply (used for internal circuitry and business-end IO)
- separate AGND and AVCC supply for the clock multiplier
- internal 3.3V LDO
- required external support circuitry:
  - USB D+ pullup
  - power-on reset circuit
  - decoupling capacitor for internal LDO
  - RC timer for oscillator bootstrap
  - 6MHz crystal
  - optionally, a 93C46 64×16-bit EEPROM

The default VID:PID of the device is `0403:6001`, unless configured otherwise by the EEPROM.  The `bcdDevice` value is `0x0200`.

UART-mode IO pins have the following functions:

- TXD, RXD, RTS#, CTS#, DTR#, DSR#, DCD#, RI#: standard UART pins
- SLEEP#: device output, goes low when in USB suspend mode
- RXLED#, TXLED#: active-low LED outputs
- PWRCTL: device input, used to generate USB descriptors when EEPROM not present or not functional
  - 0: bus-powered
  - 1: self-powered
- TXDEN: device output, high while TXD is actively transmitting data; can be used as transmitter enable for RS485 transceivers
- USBEN: device output, high after the host configures the device

FIFO-mode IO pins have the following functions:

- D0-D7, TXE#, RXF#, RD#, WR: standard FIFO-mode pins
- EEREQ#: device input, requests access to EEPROM via data bus
- EEGNT#: device output, grants access to EEPROM via data bus

The semantics of EEREQ# and EEGNT# are unclear.  They were removed from all subsequent devices.

TODO: wtf is this exactly

The EEPROM interface is 3-pin at the FTDI chip, while the EEPROM itself has a 4-pin interface.  This is because the FTDI device uses a single tied data line.  To connect the EEPROM, connect the FTDI EEDATA pin directly to the ROM's data input, and to the data output via a 2.2kΩ resistor.

## EEPROM data format

- word 0x00: always 0
- word 0x01: idVendor (USB VID)
- word 0x02: idProduct (USB PID)
- word 0x03: bcdDevice (should be 0x200)
- word 0x04: USB config (goes straight to configuration descriptor)
  - bits 0-7: bmAttributes
    - bit 5: remote wakeup enabled
    - bit 6: self-powered
    - bit 7: always set to 1
  - bits 8-15: bMaxPower (max power in units of 2mA)
- words 0x05, 0x06: always 0
- word 0x07: manufacturer string pointer
- word 0x08: product description string pointer
- word 0x09: serial number string pointer
- words 0x0a..0x3f: string / user area
- word 0x3f: checksum

String pointers are formatted as follows:

- bits 0-6: pointer to descriptor within EEPROM (counted *in bytes*)
- bit 7: always set to 1
- bits 8-15: total length of descriptor in bytes

The string descriptors are stored in ROM with the descriptor header included, as follows:

- word 0: header
  - bits 0-7: total length of descriptor in bytes (includes header)
  - bits 8-15: descriptor type (always 3 — string)
- words 1 and up: string in UTF-16

The checksum can be computed as follows:

```rust
fn checksum(eeprom: [u16; 0x40]) -> u16 {
    let mut res: u16 = 0xaaaa;
    for pos in 0..0x3f { // checksum word is NOT included — we're calculating it
        res ^= eeprom[pos];
        res = res.rotate_left(1);
    }
    res
}
```
