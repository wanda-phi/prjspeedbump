# Project Speedbump

An FTDI device reverse engineering and documentation project.

Because we all run into annoying speed bumps while working on things that actually matter.

A sister project of https://github.com/prjunnamed/prjcombine/

## Generated documentation

See https://wanda-phi.github.io/prjspeedbump/

## IRC and Matrix channel

No dedicated channel at the moment; however, we hang out in the prjcombine channel:

- [#prjcombine on libera.chat](https://web.libera.chat/?channel=#prjcombine)
- [#prjcombine:catircservices.org on matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#prjcombine:catircservices.org) (bridged with IRC)
- [channel logs](https://libera.irclog.whitequark.org/prjcombine/)

## Scope

We consider all FTDI and Bridgetek devices to be in-scope.  However, Only D2xx devices are actively prioritized at the moment.
